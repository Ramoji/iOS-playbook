# B&B 2st (1.5?) iOS Workshop

The third of February two members of the team (Elvis & Igor) had a workshop about architecture. In this workshop we discussed a few of the missing components and formalized a few others. The naming of some of the components is still not set in stone but the overall idea of the architecture of a controller that has a collection of elements that are updated over time should be the next one:

We discussed two new parts of our architecture:
- Refresher
- Empty states

## Refresher

One common task between iOS apps is to inform the networking layer to fetch new data, this is usually done by manually calling the "refresh" method in key parts of the view controller life cycle, such as view will appear, or returning from the background. We plan to encapsulate this behavior in an object that lives inside the controller (to be more specific inside SweetTableController and SweetCollectionController). This object will tell the class that inherits to refresh in the following key parts of its life cycle:

View controller:
- View will appear
- Return from background
- 30 second timer (adjustable)

App delegate:
- Push notifications
- Background refresh

The view controller related ones are quite straightforward, meanwhile the App delegate ones require some additional set up. If a refresh is in progress we won't start a new one, for this we'll use a completion block in the refresh callback to notify the refresher that is fine to start a new refresh process.

Push notifications could be solved by using NotificationCenter and background refresh by using a higher abstraction that knows about all the refreshers in your application.

## Empty states

We usually have to deal with displaying special UI for when our UI loads for the first time or when we know there's no available data. We plan to add this functionality to SweetTableController and SweetCollectionController, basically we'll have a state machine that will be composed by the following enum.

```swift
enum ContentStatus {
    case loading, hasContent, isEmpty
}
```

We'll also add an `emptyView` property that can be set by the inherited class. Finally, we'll provide a default empty view that has an image, a title and a subtitle, the user will be able to set any of this values to their own convenience.

## Persistency

We also discussed briefly what we'll use to replace Core Data. Even though Realm is very popular and has a lot of smart people working on it, it's not going to be easy to taylor it to our needs. At the same time, YapDatabase seems like an abandoned project that has a lot of open issues and is not available in other platforms (Realm is in Android, iOS and React Native). For now we decided that future projects should be built on YapDatabase, our two biggest projects already use it and it's a simpler abstraction on top of an already solid database (sqlite), meanwhile even though Realm bit be the future, it still maturing and we might reconsider our position in the future.
